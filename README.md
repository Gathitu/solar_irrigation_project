The project's purpose was to automate a solar irrigation plant. 
It involved:
- Designing a custom Atmega328P microcontroller-based Printed Circuit Board(PCB) that could be easily connected to pH, moisture, temperature, humidity, voltage and current sensors.
- Designing of an electrical circuit that used a MPTT(Solar Charge) controller to charge a 12V Li-Po Battery power and power the PCB from power received from solar panels.
- Developing a web application using Dart; whose purpose was to monitor and performing data analytics on the irrigation plantâ€™s sensor readings.
